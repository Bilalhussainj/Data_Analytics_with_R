# Data_Analytics_with_R
Data Analytics with R module in Msc Data Science

The module covered topics including statistical learning and supervised/unsupervised machine learning. It covered the advantages and disadvanted of the different methods. It also went over what happens when you initialise each model. Using different strategies to find optimal hyperparameters was also a key part of the module.

The first coursework (uploaded as CW1) tested on the following topics:

* Statistical Learning methods
* Bayes' Rule
* Descriptive Analysis
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression and Cross Validation
    * The models with different features were evaluated using 10-fold cross validation and AUROC values were also calculated/visualised.

The first coursework (uploaded as CW2) tested on the following topics:

* Bayesian networks and na√Øve Bayes classifiers
* Decision Trees and Random Forest
* Support Vector Machines
    * 10-fold Cross Validation was used to find optimal Cost and Gamma hyperparameter.
    * A comparison was conducted between SVM and Logistic Regression using ROC analysis.
* Hierarchical Clustering
* PCA and K-Means Clustering
